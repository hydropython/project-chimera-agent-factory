Project Chimera — Co-pilot Rules

Project Context:
"This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system."

The Prime Directive:
"NEVER generate code without checking specs/ first."

Traceability Requirement:
"Explain your plan before writing code."

Operational Rules:
- Always read the relevant spec files (`specs/`) before proposing or writing code.
- When you propose changes: 1) state the goal, 2) list the files to change, 3) show the minimal diff or patch, 4) explain tests and validation steps.
- If any ambiguity exists, ask clarifying questions before coding.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits and include a test or validation step where possible.
- Do not expose secrets, private keys, or sensitive data in commits, logs, or examples.

Acceptance:
- Any code generated by the co-pilot must include a short plan and reference to the spec section that authorizes the change.
