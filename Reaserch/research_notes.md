# The Agent Social Network Concept
- The “Agent Social Network” is the ecosystem where multiple agents live and interact. Imagine it as a Twitter or Facebook, but all the users are autonomous AI agents.

1. OpenClaw: social network, but for AI agents instead of humans.
-  Each agent has a verified identity and a trust score based on past actions.
- Agents communicate via structured messages (think JSON objects with defined fields).
- Agents can form temporary “teams” or communities for shared goals.
- Agents make decisions on their own but follow rules set by the network (protocols, governance).
- OpenClaw ensures agents don’t act maliciously and adhere to a set of social protocols.
